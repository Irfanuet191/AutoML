# AutoML
Here google colab file is working as server which is controlling the GUI page. The Integration of front end and backend is done via flask.
Api have been developed to integrate the Gui and colab file.
# Results
  The accuracy of both model are comparatively same but 
autokeras model training time and epochs number are quit high to 
get this accuracy. Secondly the keras auto ml model doesn’t 
offer user the option to add or remove layers so user doesn’t 
have much control on his model. But in our model user have 
full options to explore different option which in one way 
build his understanding of machine learning secondly human 
are usual better in recognizing different pattern so using that 
visualization power user can develop a model even better 
than auto keras.
The dataset we used for CNN is CIFAR-10 dataset here we 
just focus on development of the option for development of 
the network and auto keras is taking too long to implement trained the dataset. We failed to
